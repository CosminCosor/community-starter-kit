### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: To develop a Probot app, you will first need a recent version of Node.js installed.
- **qa-needed**: QA is always helpful
- **documentation-needed**: Suggest changes on GitHub
- **bug-high-priority**: Report any bug
- **bug-low-priority**: Report any bug
- **help-wanted**: Found a mistake or want to help improve this documentation?

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
